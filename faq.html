        <h1>Q&A</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>What's the point of this site?</li>
            <p>This site is to help me keep track of my goals and a way to for me to go back on my completed goals.</p>
            <br>
            <li>Do you plan to keep the site active? </li>
            <p>I plan to keep all my progress on going. This site will stay as a reminder to my children and grandchildren that anything is possible.</p>
            <br>
            <li>How often do you plan to update the site?</li>
            <p>I plan to update the site every day for each goal that I accomplish.</p>
            <br>
            <li>Do you plan to hang out with friends during the time of completing your goals?</li>
            <p>During my free time, I plan too, but I'm strictly limiting my time around friends that don't contribute to my goals.</p>
            <br>
            <li>On this journey, who is your biggest support?</li>
            <p>My mom has been my biggest support. I wont be here now making this site without her.</p>
            <br>
            <li>What are you willing to sacrifice?</li>
            <p>My friends and free time to achieve my goals as those things will only slow me down.</p>
            <br>
            <li>Would you add another section to the site?</li>
            <p>Not at the current moment, but I do plan on adding a spiritual section sometime in the future.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>If you have any questions feel free to let me know</p>
