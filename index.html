            <p class="reason">I'm making this site to keep track of my goals and to inspire people that I come across that anything is possible. This site will show my 
                dedication and will-power that I want to change my life around and be successful. Other elements the site will have is a vision board for each long-term 
                goal and a way to prove that I have indeed accomplished the goal. Each goal will be long-term broken down into short-term goals. This will help me see 
                that my goals can be accomplished and allow me to see my goals decreasing. I hope this site inspires you to chase your goals.</p>
